# `comment-meaningless`

> Comments should be meaningful, not just '+1'-style bumps.

Posting replies containing just _"+1"_, \__any update?"_, or other phrases that don't add any new meaning to the discussion can be mildly disruptive:

- They send a notification to everybody subscribed to the issue or PR
- They take up space and crowd out more meaningful comments

## Alternatives to "+1"s and "-1"s

Enthusiasm for an issue is great, but posting just a _+1_ or _me too_ isn't an effective way to make your case.
If you have new information not yet posted then it's best to post that to support your opinion.
Otherwise, stick to [GitHub emoji reactions](https://github.blog/news-insights/product-news/add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments).

## Alternatives to Asking for Updates

Most open source repositories perform all activity in public.
If there is any progress made, such as a PR being sent or updated, you'll see it publicly.
There's no need to explicitly ask for updates in repos that work in public this way.
